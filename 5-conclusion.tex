\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We described a novel approach for encoding the source and target text based on
Huffman coding schemes, eliminating the use of the \emph{unknown word} symbol.
An important continuation of our work would be to develop heuristics for
effectively grouping ``similar'' words in the source and target text, so that
they tend to have encodings that share a symbol. Even with our naive grouping
by corpus frequency, our approach offers a simple way to predict both common
and rare words in a neural translation model. As a result, performance improves
by up to 1.7 BLEU. We expect that the simplicity of our technique will allow
for straightforward combination with other enhancements and neural models.
